# Quiz App
QuizApp is a free and open-source quiz application that lets you play fully customized quizzes right in the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies

 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/#download). Note that npm is also installed, so if you are going to use it, you are through with the preliminary steps.

2. Fire Up the Local Server
```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
